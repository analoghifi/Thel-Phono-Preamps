this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* different dimensions original: xxmm x xxmm -> this PCB: 155mm x 69.65mm  
* mounting hole spacing original: original: xxmm x xxmm -> this PCB: 148mm x 62mm  
* make use of my \"universal capacitor footprint\" for the filter caps (C1,C21,C22,C23,C24,C25,C26,C27) -> see here T.B.D.  
* C1 is in a different location on the board  
* using a 5.0mm/7.5mm pin spacing combination footprint for all other small (foil and ceramic) caps (C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10,C11,C14,C15)  
* more massive ground and power supply PCB tracks  
* additional GND track unterneath U1 and U2 
  
\*(same schematic / same 1-layer\** layout THT / same THT components in the same places on the board)  
\**(strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)
