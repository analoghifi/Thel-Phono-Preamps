this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* different dimensions original: xxmm x xxmm -> this PCB: xxmm x xxmm
* make use of my universal capacitor foorprint for the filter caps -> see here   
* more massive ground and power supply PCB tracks  
* additional GND track unterneath  
  
\*(same schematic / 1-layer\** layout THT / same components in the same places on the board)  
\**(Strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)

these are KiCad 6.x projects
